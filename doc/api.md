Oblyk Api Documentation
=====================

Welcome to the oblyk API documentation.  
Here, you will find a set of endpoints allowing you to freely consult the open database of climbing crags and routes of the world.

### Authorization

There are no limitations to the use of Oblyk's APIs.  
We will just ask you to register for free to get your application key
which you will have to add in the header `HttpApiAccessToken` to access the APIs.

Create your organisation here : [Oblyk - Organization](https://oblyk.org/organization)  
And for all your requests to the API add the following header:

<pre><code>HttpApiAccessToken: [your-oblyk-api-access-token]</code></pre>

### Suggesting an evolution

If you need a particular route that is not in this documentation, 
you can suggest that we develop it by posting an issue 
on the [oblyk/oblyk-api](https://github.com/oblyk/oblyk-api) GitHub project
